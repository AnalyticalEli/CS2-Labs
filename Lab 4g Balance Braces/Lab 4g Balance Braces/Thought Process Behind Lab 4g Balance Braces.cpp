/*I can already that I'm going to have to iterate through the string using chars

And if thats the case, then the data type I'm using for the functions is char



I'll have to create 2-3 functions


The first one or two functions will be identifying and ensuring if there is a balance.


The third one will be the actual function that iterators through. Use itr::iterator*/
